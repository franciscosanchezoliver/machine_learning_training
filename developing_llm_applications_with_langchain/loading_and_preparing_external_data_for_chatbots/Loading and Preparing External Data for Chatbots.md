#LLM #RAG

One limitation of the LLMs is that they have a knowledge cut-off due to being trained up to certain point. 

In this chapter, you'll learn to create application that use **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** to integrate external data with LLMs.

The **RAG workflow** contains a few different processes, including **splitting data**, **creating and storing the embeddings** using a vector database, and **retrieving the most relevant information** for use in the application.
