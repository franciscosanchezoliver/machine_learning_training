# The Evolution of Generative AI


## GANs
We are already familiar with the first model innovation GANs(Generative 
Adversarial Networks).

Remember that these models consists of __generator models and discriminator models
that compete with one another__.

Introduced in 2014, GANs brought a massive leap in the quality of results that
generative techniques could produce.


## Transformer

The second model innovation we'll discuss is the transformer.

This powerful model type is designed to __understand and process text by 
considering multiple words and their relations at once, rather than focusing 
on individual words one at a time__.

Consider the sentence: "The animal didn't cross the street because it was 
too tired". Here the model recognizes that "it" refers to the animal. 

Now, take the sentence: "The animal didn't cross the street because it was 
too wide". In this case, the model understands that "it" refers to the street.

Transformers excel at grasping the context of a given text, which allow them 
to generate more coherent responses.

By analyzing relationships between words and seeing the text as a whole, 
transformers can generate responses that feel natural and informative
