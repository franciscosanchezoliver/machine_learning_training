There are 2 main branches of statistics: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.

**Descriptive statistics** focuses on **describing and summarizing the data at hand**.

Example: 
After asking our friends how they get to work, we can see that:
- 50% drive to work
- 25% ride the bus
- 25% bike

**Inferential statistics uses the data at hand**, which is called "**sample data**", **to make inferences about a larger population**.

We could use inferential statistics to figure out what percent of people drive to work based on our sample data.

There are **2** main **types of data**: **numeric (quantitative)** and **categorical (qualitative)**.

**Numeric (or quantitative)** data is made up of **numeric values**.

Categorical, or qualitative data is made up of values that belong to distinct groups.

It's important to note that these aren't the only two types of data that exist. There are others too, but we'll be focusing on these two.

Numeric data can be further separated into continuous and discrete data.

Continuous numeric data is often quantities that be measured, like speed or time.

Discrete numeric data is usually count data, like number of pets or number of packages shipped.

Categorical data can be nominal (unordered) or ordinal (ordered).

Nominal categorical data is made up of categories with no inherent ordering, like marriage status or country residence.

**Ordinal categorical** data has an inherent **order**, like a survey question where you need to indicate the degree to which you agree with a statement.
Ex: 
- [ ] Strongly disagree
- [ ] Somewhat disagree
- [ ] Neither agree nor disagree
- [ ] Somewhat agree
- [ ] Strongly agree

Sometimes categorical variables are represented using numbers. Example: married and unmarried can be represented using 1 and 0, or an agreement scale could be represented with numbers 1 through 5.
However its important to note that this doesn't necessarily make them numeric variables.

Being able to identify data types is important since the type of data you're working with will dictate what kind of summary statistics and visualizations make sense for your data, so this is an important skill to master.

For numerical data, we can use summary statistics like mean, and plots like scatter plots, but these don't make a lot of sense for categorical data.

Similarly, things like counts and barplots don't make much sense for numeric data.

Exercise: Identify which questions can be answered with descriptive statistics and which questions can be answered with inferential statistics.

Descriptive:
- Given data on all 100,000 people who viewed an ad, what percent of people clicked on it?
- Given data on every customer service request made, what's the average time it took to respond?

Inferential:
- Given data on 20 fish caught in a lake, what's the average weight of all fish in the lake?
- After interviewing 100 customers, what percent of all your customers are satisfied with your product?

Exercise: Map each variable to its data type by dragging each item and dropping it into the correct data type.

Continuous numeric:
 - Air temperature
 - Kilowatts of electricity used

Discrete numeric:
- Number of DataCamp couses taken
- Number of items in stock

Categorical:
- Zip code
- Brand of a product
