A subset of artificial intelligence. 

Artificial intelligence is a multidisciplinary field of computer science that aims to create systems capable of emulating and surpassing human-level intelligence.

Machine learning: learn from existing data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed.

Deep learning: a subset of machine learning that uses "neural networks" to learn from the data.

Generative AI: within deep learning we have generative AI.

## Generative AI 

It is the subfield of deep learning that focuses on generating new content such as: images, text, audio, video, code, 3d objects, synthetic data.

Generative AI is build using a very specific model known as _generative model_ . These models takes large data sets like images, text and sounds as input. 

A second phase, a deep learning model is used to search patterns within the data. 

Once the model has completed the learning process, we can use them to for example: 
- Generating synthetic images base on existing ones. Or modify the style of an image
- Performing task as: translation, question and answering generation (Question Answering), or interpret the meaning of a text (semantic search).
- Converting audio snippets into text (Speech to text). Get the lyrics of a song. 

Innovative Deep Learning Models:
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Transformers Architecture
- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)

Those models have the capacity of processing large datasets and have a "human behavior".

Many of those models need powerful GPUs, but are available in the cloud.
