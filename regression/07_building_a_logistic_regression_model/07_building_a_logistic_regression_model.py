"""
Building a logistic regression model
------------------------------------
In this exercise, you will build a logistic regression model using all features in the
diabetes_df dataset. The model will be used to predict the probability of individuals
in the test set having a diabetes diagnosis.

We'll use the diabetes dataset.

To do:
- Split the data into train and test set.
- Create a Logistic Regression model.
- Fit it to the train set.
- Predict the probabilities of the test.
